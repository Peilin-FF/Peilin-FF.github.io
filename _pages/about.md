<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My name is Peilin Feng (冯沛林), an undergraduate student at **Beihang University**(2021-2025), majoring in **Automation Science and Electrical Engineering** with a minor in **Mathematical Sciences**. Under the supervision of [Professor Lei Huang](https://huangleibuaa.github.io/), I am currently focusing on Sequence Modeling and Multi-agent systems. In the future, I will contribute to project [Tiny-Llava](https://github.com/TinyLLaVA/TinyLLaVA_Factory), where I aim to explore text and image modeling.

I also have a deep passion for mathematics. I serve as a teaching assistant for the Mathematical Analysis for Engineering course. My responsibilities include grading homework, answering students' questions, and leading review lectures.
Outside of my academic and research interests, I enjoy playing ping pong 🏓 and swimming 🤿. In my leisure time, I like to listen to some music 🎵 and watch my favorite cartoon Doraemon 📺 for relax.


My research interests span the intersection of NLP and Computer Vision, with a particular focus on Multi-agent systems. This stems from my dedication to creating an AGI similar to Doraemon 🐱. Currently, I am actively working to bridge my knowledge gaps in this area, with the goal of becoming an expert in the field. 

However, artificial intelligence is developing rapidly, so I always hope to be at the forefront of the field and use my intelligence to devote to our society. I believe that is an exciting exploring travel.

[Bench-CoE: a Framework for Collaboration of Experts from Benchmark](./profiles/paper/benchcoe.pdf)

Yuanshuai Wang\*, Xingjian Zhang\*, Jinkun Zhao\*, Siwei Wen, **Peilin Feng**, Shuhao Liao, Lei Huang<sup>✉</sup>, Wenjun Wu<sup>✉</sup>

# 💡 Contribution
- We proposed a novel framework for Bench-CoE that relies solely on the Benchmark when training the router.
- We comprehensively evaluated the performance and generalization ability of our Bench-CoE model across three stages: Naive, In-distribution, and Out-of-distribution.
